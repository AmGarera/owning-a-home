        <h1>Understanding loan types</h1>

        <p class="lead">The type of mortgage you choose has a big impact on how much you end up paying – how much you owe upfront, your monthly payment amount, and the total cost of your loan over time. Knowing what type of loan is most appropriate for your situation prepares you for talking to lenders and getting the best deal.</p>

                          <p>Shorter terms will generally save you money overall, but have higher monthly payments. There are two reasons shorter terms can save you money:  </p>

                          <ol>
                            <li>You are borrowing money and paying interest for a shorter amount of <strong>time</strong>.</li>
                            <li>The <strong>interest rate</strong> is usually lower — by as much as a full percentage point — with a shorter term than with a longer term.</li>
                          </ol>

                          <p>Rates are different at different lenders, especially for shorter terms. Don’t rely on guesswork to make your decision. Always compare official loan offers (called <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/askcfpb/" id="good-faith-link">Good Faith Estimates</a>) to make sure you’re getting the right deal for you.</p>

                            <p class="alert">Some lenders, especially in rural areas, may offer balloon loans.

                    <h3 class="section-heading">Deciphering Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARMs)</h3>

                    <p>Most ARMs are structured into two separate periods. During the first period, your interest rate is fixed and won’t change. During the second period, your rate adjusts regularly based on market changes.</p>

                    <h4>Sample Adjustable Rate Mortgage</h4>

                    <div class="arm-content">
                      <div class="arm-fixed">
                        <h5 class="arm-heading"><span class="highlight">5</span> / 1 ARM: Fixed period</h5>
                        <p class="mid-lead">This “5” represents how many years your inital interest rate will stay fixed.</p>
                        <p class="sub light">The most common options are 3, 5, 7, and 10 years.</p>

                        <h5 class="arm-heading">5 / <span class="highlight">1</span> ARM: Adjustable  period</h5>
                        <p class="mid-lead">This “1” represents how often your rate changes after the fixed period expires.</p>
                        <p class="sub light">The most common option is 1, meaning the rate will adjust every year. At each one of these intervals, you would receive a new rate with a new payment amount.</p>
                        <p class="sub light">The changes to your rate will be based on the market conditions. <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/askcfpb/" id="ask-rate-changes-more">Learn more</a></p>
                      </div>
                    </div> <!-- /.arm-content -->

                    <p class="sans l-bump">Other, less common structures that follow this basic pattern include 5/5 (fixed for the first 5 years, adjusts every 5 years thereafter) and 3/3 (fixed for the first 3 years, adjusts every 3 years thereafter). ARMs typically have a 30-year loan term.</p>

                    <div class="note l-bump">

                      <h5 class="callout-mid-heading alert">ARMs can have other structures.</h5>
                      <p>Not all ARMs follow the above pattern.  Some ARMs may adjust every 6 months, or even every 1 month, and there’s not a standard way that these are described. If you’re considering a nonstandard structure, make sure to carefully read the rules and ask questions about when and how your rate and payment can adjust. </p>

                      <h5 class="callout-mid-heading">Most ARMs include caps on how much your rate can adjust.</h5>
                      <p>ARMs include specific rules that dictate how your new rate and payment will be calculated at each adjustment interval.  Rate changes are calculated using a market index (benchmark) plus a lender’s profit margin, but not all lenders use the same index or charge the same margin.  Most ARMs also include caps on how much your rate and payment can adjust. Make sure you understand how these rules work. If you don’t, ask questions! </p>

                      <h5 class="callout-mid-heading">ARMs marketed to people with lower credit scores tend to be riskier.</h5>
                      <p>If you have a credit score in the mid-600s or below, you are more likely to be offered ARMs that contain features that are risky for you such as: higher rates, rates that adjust more frequently, pre-payment penalties, and loan balances that can increase. Consult with multiple lenders and get a quote for an FHA loan as well. Then, you can compare all your options.</p>
