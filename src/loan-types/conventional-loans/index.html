        <section id="conventional-overview" class="col-9">
          <p>“Conventional” just means that the loan is not part of a specific government program. Conventional loans typically have lower costs than FHA loans but stricter standards for approval. There are two main categories of conventional loans–conforming and non-conforming.</p>
          <p>Conforming loans have maximum loan amounts that are set by the government. Other rules for conforming loans are set by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, companies that provide backing for conforming loans).</p>
          <p>Non-conforming loans are less standardized. Eligibility, pricing, and features can vary widely by lender, so it’s particularly important to shop around and compare several offers.</p>

        <p>Stronger government regulation means that many of these loans won’t return, but some will. Non-conforming loans marketed to people with lower credit scores are more likely to have high rates and contain risky features, such as rates that adjust more than once per year, <a href="#">prepayment penalties</a>, and <a href="#">loan balances that can increase</a>. If you are considering a non-conforming loan, consult with multiple lenders. Ask if you could qualify for a conforming or <a href="/loan-types/FHA-loans/">FHA loan</a> instead.

          <h3>Mortgage Insurance: What you need to know</h3>

          <p>Mortgage insurance helps you get a loan you wouldn’t otherwise be able to get. If you can’t afford a 20 percent down payment, you will likely have to pay for  some kind mortgage insurance.  You may choose to get a conventional loan with private mortgage insurance (PMI), or an FHA, VA, or USDA loan.</p>
          <p>Mortgage insurance usually adds to your costs. Depending on the loan type, you will pay monthly mortgage insurance premiums, an upfront mortgage insurance fee, or both.  Mortgage insurance is an important component of your total loan cost, but so is the interest rate, which varies widely depending on your loan type, down payment amount, and the specific lender.  If you’re considering multiple options, ask lenders for quotes for each option and compare total costs to see which option offers the best overall deal.</p>
          <p>Mortgage insurance—no matter what kind—protects the lender in the event that you fall behind on your payments. It does not protect you. Your credit score will suffer and you may face foreclosure if you don’t pay your mortgage on time. </p>
