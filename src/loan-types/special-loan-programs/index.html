      <h2>Special Loan Progams</h2>

      <p>Special loan programs exist for borrowers that meet specific eligibility criteria.  For those that qualify, these programs can often be more affordable than a <a href="/loan-types/conventional-loans/">conventional</a> or <a href="/loan-types/FHA-loans/">FHA loan</a>, so make sure to investigate if you are eligible.  Always compare official loan offers (called <a href="#">Good Faith Estimates</a>) before making a final decision.</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/" id="va-external-link">Veterans Administration (VA)</a> has a loan program for <strong>veterans, current servicemembers, and surviving spouses</strong>.  The program is similar to the <a href="/loan-types/FHA-loans/" id="va-fha-link">FHA</a> program, but partially subsidized so it can offer a better deal for <a href="#">those who qualify</a>. VA loans also offer low-cost, streamlined refinance options and some additional protections if you have trouble paying your mortgage later on.</p>

            <p>Unlike FHA loans, VA loans do not require monthly mortgage insurance premiums, but usually require an upfront fee at closing. <a href="#mortgage-insurance">Learn more about mortgage insurance</a>.</p>

            <p>VA loans are available with low or even zero down payments, but may be more expensive than <a href="/loan-types/conventional-loans/">conventional loans</a>. If you have significant down payment funds and good credit, you should compare VA and conventional loans to see which offers the better deal.</p>

            <p>Many states, local governments, and local nonprofits offer various programs to help make homeownership more affordable.

            <p>Many programs offer down payment assistance that can be used with a regular <a href="/loan-types/FHA-loans/">FHA</a> or conventional loan. Some programs lend money directly through subsidized loans. </p>

          <h3>Mortgage Insurance: What you need to know</h3>

          <p class="bump"><strong>Mortgage insurance helps you get a loan you wouldn’t otherwise be able to get.</strong> If you can’t afford a 20 percent down payment, you will likely have to pay for  some kind mortgage insurance.  You may choose to get a conventional loan with private mortgage insurance (PMI), or an FHA, VA, or USDA loan.</p>
          <p><strong>Mortgage insurance usually adds to your costs.</strong> Depending on the loan type, you will pay monthly mortgage insurance premiums, an upfront mortgage insurance fee, or both.  Mortgage insurance is an important component of your total loan cost, but so is the interest rate, which varies widely depending on your loan type, down payment amount, and the specific lender.  If you’re considering multiple options, ask lenders for quotes for each option and compare total costs to see which option offers the best overall deal.</p>
          <p><strong>Mortgage insurance—no matter what kind—protects the lender in the event that you fall behind on your payments. It does not protect you.</strong> Your credit score will suffer and you may face foreclosure if you don’t pay your mortgage on time. </p>
