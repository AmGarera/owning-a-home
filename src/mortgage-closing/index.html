        what you are legally committing to and what you are signing. Ask questions
        until you feel comfortable with everything, and take all the time you need.</h2>

        <h2>Three things you should do right now</h2>

        <h3 class="u-mt45">1. Get ready for closing</h3>
        <p>Closing is one of the most important parts of the mortgage process. It’s where you legally commit to your mortgage loan. You’ll have three days to review your closing documents and our closing checklist will let you know what to expect and what questions to ask so you will be prepared.</p>
        <p><a href="/owning-a-home/resources/checklist_mortgage_closing.pdf" class="icon-link icon-link__pdf"><span class="icon-link_text">Review the closing checklist</span></a></p>

        <h3 class="u-mt60">2. Review your Closing Disclosure </h3>
        <p>You may have already received your Closing Disclosure, which summarizes your loan terms and closing costs. Our Closing Disclosure explainer will show you what to look out for and what details to double-check.</p>
        <p><a href="/owning-a-home/form-explainer/closing-disclosure.html" class="icon-link icon-link__right"><span class="icon-link_text">Explore the Closing Disclosure explainer</span></a></p>

        <h3 class="u-mt60">3. Review the rest of your closing documents</h3>

        <p>In addition to reviewing your Closing Disclosure, there are other important documents you will need to sign at closing, such as the promissory note and the deed of trust. Get a head start on reviewing these documents by asking your closing agent for a copy of your closing packet in advance. We can help you navigate the forms.</p>
