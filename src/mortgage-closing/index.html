      <h3 class="u-mt30 u-mb20">What to do now</h3>
      <h4 class="u-mb5">1. Review your Closing Disclosure</h4>
      <p>It’s important to review your Closing Disclosure before closing. Make sure everything is as you expect in advance, while you still have time to ask questions and correct any errors.</p>

      </p>
      <h4 class="u-mb5">3. Review the rest of your closing documents </h4>
      <p>In addition to your Closing Disclosure, there are other important documents you will need to sign at closing, such as the promissory note and the deed of trust. Get a head start on reviewing these documents by asking your closing agent for a copy of your closing packet in advance. We can help you navigate these documents.</p>

      <h4 class="u-mb5">4. Get any errors fixed now, before closing. </h4>
      <p>If you find an error in one of your closing documents, call your loan officer or settlement agent and get the error fixed right away. Even minor misspellings can delay your closing or cause big problems in the future.</p>
