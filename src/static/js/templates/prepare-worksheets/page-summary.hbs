              The next step is to explore how much it will cost to buy a home that meets your goals, and whether buying makes sense financially.  For most people, owning a home will end up being more expensive than their current rental.  Before you start house shopping in earnest, it’s a good idea to get a clear sense for how much buying will cost, so you can decide for yourself if the benefits are worth the cost.

              Are there red flags in your situation, or risks you’re not ready to accept?   That’s ok.  Sometimes, the smartest home buying decision is deciding not to buy – at least not right now.  Consider pursuing the alternatives you identified, so that you can meet some of your goals right away.  Or, consider working to build a larger financial cushion so you will be better able to accept the risks of homeownership when the time is right for you.
