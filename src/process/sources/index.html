What few data sources exist tend to lump together major maintenance projects, such as a new roof or furnace, with discretionary improvements such as anew kitchen.  However, 1% of the home price per year is a common rule of thumb used in many homebuyer educational materials, including the <i>Home Buying Kit for Dummies</i> by Eric Tyson and Ray Brown (2012, 5th edition, page 51).</p>
