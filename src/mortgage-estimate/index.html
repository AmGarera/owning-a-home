    <h2 class="first-content-main-heading">What to do now</h2>

    <h3 class="h4 u-mb5">Get more than one Loan Estimate</h3>
    <p>It’s hard to know if you’re getting a good deal on your loan if you don’t have anything to compare it to. By getting Loan Estimates from more than one lender, you can compare your options and choose the best one.</p>
    <p><a href="/owning-a-home/loan-options/compare/" class="icon-link icon-link__right"><span class="icon-link_text">Shop for multiple Loan Estimates</span></a></p>

    <h3 class="h4 u-mb5 u-mt45">Review your Loan Estimate</h3>
    <p>Learn what to look out for, and what details to double check. We've also got definitions for unfamiliar </p>
    <p><a href="/owning-a-home/form-explainer/" class="icon-link icon-link__right"><span class="icon-link_text">Explore our Loan Estimate explainer</span></a></p>

    <h3 class="h4 u-mb5 u-mt45">Explore interest rates</h3>
    <p>We also have tools that can help you get a better sense of the range of interest rates you should expect and how your overall costs might change with different loan options. </p>
    <p><a href="/owning-a-home/check-rates/" class="icon-link icon-link__right"><span class="icon-link_text">Explore current interest rates</span></a></p>

    <h2 class="u-mt60">What happens next</h2>

    <h3 class="h4 u-mb5">You’re in control</h3>
    <p>Once you’re ready, you need tell the lender you want to proceed with a particular loan offer. At that point, the lender will typically charge you an application and appraisal fee and request additional documentation like income statements and a list of assets. If you think you might need more than 10 days to decide to proceed with a loan offer, it’s a good idea to advise the loan officer so they don't close your loan application.</p>
    <p><a href="#" class="icon-link icon-link__right"><span class="icon-link_text">Learn more about intent to proceed</span></a></p>

    <h3 class="h4 u-mb5 u-mt45">You might receive revised Loan Estimates if important numbers change</h3>
    <p>If there are changes in your application—including your loan amount, credit score, or verified income—your rate and terms will probably change too. In those situations, the lender will give you a revised Loan Estimate. If your Loan Estimate is revised you should look it over to see what changed. Ask your lender: “Can you explain why I received a new Loan Estimate?” and “How is my loan transaction different from what I was originally expecting?”</p>
