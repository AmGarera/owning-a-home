          <p class="lead">The interest and fees you pay to borrow money to buy a home can often be as much, or more, as the purchase price of the home itself. That's why it's important to think carefully about which loan option is right for you and shop around to get the best deal. The loan type you choose, your down payment amount, and the interest rate you receive all can have a big impact on your total cost. Use this tool to explore different loan scenarios and determine your best strategy.</p>
